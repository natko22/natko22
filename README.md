 🌱 Full Stack Web Developer | 💻 HTML | 🎨 CSS | 🚀 JavaScript | ⚛️ React

Hello there! I recently graduated from IRONHACK, and I'm passionate about web development. My journey has led me to learn essential technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also exploring the exciting world of React.

While I have a good grasp of these technologies, I believe in continuous learning and improvement. Every day, I try to enhance my coding skills and stay updated with the latest trends in web development.

Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in design, drawing, and photography. They fuel my creativity and inspire me to bring fresh perspectives to my projects.
