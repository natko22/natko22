 🌱 Full Stack Web Developer | 💻 HTML | 🎨 CSS | 🚀 JavaScript | ⚛️ React | 🖥️ Node.js | 🚂 Express.js

Hello there! I've always been good at solving problems, which led me to explore different fields through an orientation course. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with Web Development. 
Building Petopia(Full-Stack-App) was a crucial experience for me. I realized how much I enjoy the entire process of creating something from scratch. Whether it's researching, designing, or coding, I find joy in every step.
I'm excited to keep learning and growing in this field.

Apart from coding, I am interested in books, design, drawing, and photography. They fuel my creativity and inspire me to bring fresh perspectives to my projects.
On my GitHub, you'll find my projects, where I showcase my progress as a Web Developer.
